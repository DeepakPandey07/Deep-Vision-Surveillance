# Deep-Vision-Surveillance 
Real-time object detection optimized for intelligence and surveillance operations.

## Project Overview
This project leverages the *YOLOv8* (You Only Look Once) architecture to identify and track objects in real-time video feeds. It is designed to be lightweight and deployable on edge devices for field operations.

## Key Features
- *Real-time Detection:* High-speed inference using the YOLOv8-Nano model.
- *Multi-Object Tracking:* Capable of detecting personnel, vehicles, and equipment simultaneously.
- *OpenCV Integration:* Seamless live camera feed processing.

## Tech Stack
- *Language:* Python 3.8+
- *Frameworks:* Ultralytics (YOLOv8), OpenCV

## Installation
```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
